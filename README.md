# Overview

This project serves as a hands-on experience to solidify my understanding of object-oriented programming, sprite management, and game mechanics.

The game I created is a classic Space Invaders-style shooter. Players control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, moving left and right to dodge incoming enemies while firing bullets to eliminate them. The objective is to score points by destroying as many enemies as possible before they reach the player's ship.

My purpose for writing this software was to improve my coding skills and learn how to create a fully functional game from scratch.

# Development Environment

I developed this game using Python utilizing the Arcade library.

- Python 3: The programming language used for writing the game.
- Arcade Library: A powerful Python library that simplifies game development and allows for easy sprite handling and rendering.
